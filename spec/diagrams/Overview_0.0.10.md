## Overview of modules in release v0.0.10
This section describes the set of modules covered by an upfront AIPS 0.0.10, which is again exclusively for testing.  

There are no changes between 0.0.9 and 0.0.10 on module level.  
As 0.0.9 did not provide a complete set of updated specification files, the missing parts are being delivered with 0.0.10 along with bugfixes.  
This includes updates to:  
- forwardingList
- profileList and profileInstancesList
- OAS
- configFile
- loadFile
